            <h4>1. 3D Solar System.</h4>
            <p>This project is an interactive 3D representation of the solar system, designed to educate
                users about the planets and their orbits. Utilizing WebGL and JavaScript, the application
                allows users to explore each planet in detail, showcasing features such as size comparisons,
                orbital paths, and unique characteristics. Users can navigate through space, zoom in on planets,
                and access informative pop-ups that provide facts about each celestial body. This project highlights
                my skills in 3D modeling and interactive design, demonstrating my ability to create engaging educational
                tools.</p>

            <h4>2. Portfolio with Image Slider Style</h4>
            <p>This project showcases a dynamic portfolio presented in an engaging image slider format. The
                design allows users to navigate through various projects seamlessly, enhancing the visual
                experience while highlighting my work effectively.</p>

            <h4>3. Animated Landing Page </h4>
            <p>This project features a visually captivating animated landing page designed to engage users from
                the moment they arrive. The landing page combines striking visuals with smooth animations to
                create an immersive experience that effectively communicates the brand's message and encourages
                user interaction.</p>

            <h4>4. Crop Prediction System</h4>
            <p>This project is a data-driven application that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict crop yields based on various
                environmental factors such as soil quality, weather conditions, and historical yield data. By implementing Python and libraries
                like Scikit-learn, I developed models that analyze input data to provide farmers with actionable insights on which crops are
                likely to thrive in specific conditions. The system aims to optimize agricultural productivity and resource management,
                showcasing my ability to apply data science techniques to real-world problems.</p>
